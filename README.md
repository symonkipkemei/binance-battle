<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Binance Battle</h1>

![Networth](img/battle.JPG)

**Binance-Supremacy-Battle**

A classical supremacy battle of who is the most fast(volatile) and strongest(momentum) coin/symbol pair  amongst usdt pairs within 24hrs . The battle takes place at the USDT SPOT MARKET (the base quote).The bulls front has been explored for now. Each battle lasts for 24hrs.

The draw  happens in the first 8 hrs starting from UTC +00.00  to select the top 10 strongest(momentum change) symbol pairs  in both fronts.

After the draw takes place, the top 10 symbol pairs are monitored after 24hrs and their vitals captured (High, low, close) .

The vitals are analyzed at the end of the 24hrs for each symbol pair and deductions made to determine if their speed and strength was steady for 24hrs after the draw.

The parameters of analysis are:

1. high (after 24 hrs) - close( after the initial draw)
2. the variation of close and high in percentage
4. If the change was positive or negative,if positive profit was made


**Hypothesis**

- The top 10 symbol pairs can potentially yield a profit-margin of 1-2% after the draw.
