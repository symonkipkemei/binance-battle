**Binance-Supremacy-Battle**

A classical supremacy battle of who is the most fast(volatile) and strongest(momentum) coin/symbol pair  amongst usdt pairs within 24hrs . The battle takes place at the USDT SPOT MARKET (the base quote).There are two fronts; the bear front and the bulls front. Each battle lasts for 24hrs.

The draw  happens in the first 8 hrs starting from UTC +00.00  to select the top 10 strongest(momentum change) symbol pairs  in both fronts.

After the draw takes place, the top 10 symbol pairs are monitored at intervals of 4hrs( 4 times) and their vitals captured ( Open, High, low, close, Volume) and stored in a mysql database.

The battle ends at UTC +00.00 Upon which another battle preceeded with a draw commences.

The vitals are analyzed at the end of the 24hrs for each symbol pair and deductions made to determine if their speed and strength was steady for 16hrs after the draw.

The parameters of analysis are subject to further study .

The analysis will be served at an endpoint (e.g. using sandman2)


**Hypothesis**

- The top 10 symbol pairs can potentially yield a profit-margin of 1-2% after the draw.
